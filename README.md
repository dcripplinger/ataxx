# ataxx
Rudimentary command-line version of the game Ataxx with AI available. I used it to help me beat the game on The 7th Guest.

This code is not meant to be at all polished or designed for outside use. (But if you do want to use it, go ahead!) For a more formal coding project, I would of course be adding plenty of documentation and tests. I like to showcase this code because it is an example of a problem I was personally motivated to solve outside of work or any organization. In just 3 days' time, I taught myself the basics of AI in the context of games like Chess, built the code to model the game Ataxx, and built an AI that enabled me to beat the AI within the classic horror game The 7th Guest. I used the Level 3 Greedy algorithm to beat it.

Here's a YouTube video of the game I played against The 7th Guest's AI, where I beat it using my AI's suggested moves:
